XQuery statement to find how many yers Professor Cristea has been teaching 'Advanced Databases'

let $y := distinct-values(doc("teachers.xml")/teachers/teacher[name="Alexandra Cristea"]/course/submodule[name="Advanced Databases"]/year)
RETURN <numYears>
        {count($y)}
       </numYears>


i. I interpreted the question as asking for the total number of years Professor Cristea has taught the 'Advanced Databases' submodule, including the current year, at Durham University. My solution returns a count of the number of years that they taught this module and as such is a correct solution.
ii. I do not believe there are any limitations to my approach, it is suitable and correct even if the Database were extended.
iii. 

<numYears> 2 </numYears>

iv. count(doc("teachers.xml")/teachers/teacher[name="Alexandra Cristea"]/course/submodule[name="Advanced Databases"]/year)
