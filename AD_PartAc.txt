It is not possible to construct a correct DTD file for students.xml. This is as the student element has an inconsistent structure: the first student has the subelements 'name' and 'course', whereas the second student has 3 unique subelements: 'firstname', 'lastname' and 'course'. As such it would be impossible to create a DTD for the student element, as it is not possible to specify which naming convention to use.
