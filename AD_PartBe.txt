i. The natural language query asks how many students and teachers in the database do not have a username stored for them. My solution checks to see if they have a last name varaible and if they have whitesapce in their name variable, either of which would indicate that they have a lastname stored in the database.
ii. Limitations of this solution are that if someone had whitespace in their forename (i.e. double barelled forenames) but no lastname the query would not count them.
iii. 0
iv. This would not be possible in XPath as it requires the joining of files.
