XPath query to find all teachers who teach advanced databases this year

doc("teachers.xml")/teachers//teacher[descendant::submodule[name="Advanced Databases"][year="2019-2020"]]

i. I interpreted the natural language query as asking for all teacher elements that teach Advanced Databases in the year 2020. My query returns all such elements and is therefore appropriate.
ii. As in question a), the elements themselves, instead of the teacher names, are returned. This could be a limitation due to misinterpretation of the natural language query. Otherwise I believe there are no limitaitons.
iii.
